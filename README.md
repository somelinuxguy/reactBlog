# Let's learn React
I often deal with Wordpress or other such content delivering APIs, so I thought it would be fun to learn React and see how I would go about barfing the blog list returned from Wordpress, on to a page.

First iteration is to just use a static blog list, to get the page working "right" before I then add in some fetch() code to try nabbing it all from Wordpress, then unraveling their JSON response.

Just to prove a point: You don't need Wordpress to use Wordpress.

You'll figure out what that means.
